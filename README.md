# EasyShop-E-Commerce-Analysis
# Project description
Business Intelligence project for EasyShop using SQL Server, Power BI, and Excel to transform e-commerce data into actionable insights, improve engagement, and optimize marketing spend.
# Business Case
EasyShop, an online retailer, is experiencing declining customer engagement and conversion rates despite significant marketing investments. High marketing expenses are not delivering expected returns, and customer feedback points to possible gaps in products and services.

This project uses SQL Server, Power BI, and Excel to analyze campaign performance, customer interactions, and feedback data. The goal is to identify underperforming strategies, uncover customer behavior patterns, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve engagement, increase conversions, and optimize marketing spend.
# ðŸ›  Tools Used


SQL Server â€“ For data storage, cleaning, and transformation using complex queries.

Power BI â€“ For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key performance indicators.

Excel â€“ For quick data exploration, pivot tables, and ad-hoc analysis.

Python â€“ For advanced data analysis, automation, and preprocessing tasks.

ETL Process â€“ Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources into a structured format.

Data Modeling â€“ Building relationships and measures to enable meaningful analysis and reporting.

# ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

# Data Collection
Gathered e-commerce sales transactions, marketing campaign metrics, and customer feedback from EasyShopâ€™s SQL Server database, Excel files, and online review sources.

# Data Cleaning & Transformation
Used SQL Server to remove duplicate entries and filter irrelevant records.

Handled missing values and standardized formats for dates, currencies, and categories.

Merged multiple datasets (sales, marketing, and customer feedback) into a unified structure.

Applied Python (Pandas) for preprocessing text data from reviews and social media comments.

Performed sentiment analysis in Python using NLP libraries to classify feedback as positive, neutral, or negative.

Generated sentiment scores and integrated them into the main dataset for Power BI visualization.

<h1>1. Conversion Rate</h1>
<h2>Findings:</h2>

Average conversion rate is 8.5%.

Peaked in May (15.7%), dropped sharply to 5.0% in October, then recovered to 10.2% in December.

<h2>Recommendations:</h2>

Investigate causes of the October drop â€” possible campaign changes, seasonal effects, or technical issues.

Replicate strategies from May and December campaigns to sustain higher conversion rates.

<h1> 2. Customer Engagement (Social Media)</h1>
<h2>>Findings:</h2

Views steadily declined from 306K to below 200K by year-end.

Click-through rate (CTR) is 15.37%, meaning engaged viewers are still interacting effectively.

Likes are very low (2.47% of views), showing weak emotional connection with content.
<h2>    Recommendations:   </h2>


Increase content reach through targeted advertising and optimized posting times.

Test creative variations to boost likes and overall sentiment.

Re-engage audiences with interactive formats (polls, giveaways, influencer collaborations).

# 3. Customer Feedback
## Findings:

Average rating is 3.7, below the target of 4.0.

Ratings dipped to 3.5 in March, July, and September.

Some products consistently score below 3.5, indicating recurring issues.

# Recommendations:

Prioritize quality checks and service improvements for low-rated products.

Follow up with customers post-purchase to gather feedback on low-rated items.

Introduce targeted loyalty incentives for customers who rated products lower than 4.
